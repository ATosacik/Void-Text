# UniText Converter

Simple client-side tool to extract text from images (OCR), PowerPoint files, and PDFs. Everything runs in your browser. No server, no upload of your files (except for OCR).

Dark monochrome design, batch upload, collapsible results, easy copy options. Just one single HTML file.

## How to Use

1. Open the page (or `index.html` locally).
2. Pick Image / PowerPoint / PDF.
3. Drag & drop or choose your files.
4. For images: enter a free OCR.space API key (get one here: https://ocr.space/ocrapi).
5. Click "Convert to Text".
6. Copy whatever you need.

OCR needs a free API key from OCR.space (25,000 requests/month on free tier).

PowerPoint and text-based PDFs work 100% offline.
